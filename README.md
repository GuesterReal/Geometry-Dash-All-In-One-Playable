# Geometry-Dash-All-In-One-Playable
Every Geometry Dash version ever until 2.2 using the download_depot command in the Steam console and SteamDB manifests from oldest to newest.

**My version of how to play these versions. Let me know how I can improve it by commenting in Issues.** 

**As of February 6 2024, the first 3 versions cannot be played by me.**

**NOTICE:** *Some of the levels may have been played by me: Stereo Madness and other levels may show a percentage of the level played. Ignore that.*
